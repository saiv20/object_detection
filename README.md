# object_detection

This projects was built for detecting objects (especially interested in vehicles and pedestrians). YOLOv5 was used for object detection. 

## Object Detection

The yolov5-master/ folder contains the files required to perform object detection using YOLOv5. Run detect.py to detect images as follows:

    python detect.py --source imgs/1.png --weights yolov5m.pt
    
The results observed are as follows:
