# object_detection

This project was built for detecting objects (especially interested in vehicles and pedestrians). YOLOv5 was used for object detection. Learn more about YOLOv5 [here](https://pytorch.org/hub/ultralytics_yolov5/).  

## Object Detection

The yolov5-master/ folder contains the files required to perform object detection using YOLOv5. Run detect.py to detect objects.
    
The results observed are as follows:
